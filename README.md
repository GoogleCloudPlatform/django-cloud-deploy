# Django Deploy

**Django Deploy** is an experimental tool designed to make it easier to
deploy new and existing [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) applications
on public clouds
(e.g. [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)).

Currently, **Django Deploy** can only
- Deploy to [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).
- Deploy to [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).
- Deploy applications created using its own template code.

**Django Deploy** is an experimental project not officially supported by Google.

Here is an example usage:
